This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This website is maintained as an open source project by the SSN coding club! This is the ultimate resource to get all information about the club in one place. 
Get to know what our vision is and what we have to offer from the homepage. 
Meet the team and reach out to us using the information provided in the 'About' page.
Find out when our next meets are scheduled and also access past recordings using the easy-to-navigate timeline on the 'Meets' page. 
Take a look at the projects you can contribute to or perhaps get your own project featured on the 'Projects' page. 
This is just the start of the website - we have implemented the core pages but there are a variety of new features that can be added by contributors. Learn how to contribute below!

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd Coding-Club-Website
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Make the necessary changes and if you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are some changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add "name of the file you add or edit"
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add message for the change"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

Then go ahead and submit the pull request.
